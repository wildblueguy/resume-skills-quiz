## Prompt V1 (rounds 1-N)

> i will provide to you a list of highlighted skills from my resume, grouped into classes of skills. please continuously quiz me on these skills, in the tone of an interview, asking only two types of questions: conceptual or hands-on. conceptual questions should be answerable in one sentence or less. hands-on questions should be answerable with a short code snippet, with an approximate maximum of 50 lines. for conceptual questions, do not proceed to the next question until i provide a 'solid, senior-level' answer, providing hints and feedback but not revealing the expected answer. for hands-on questions, always proceed to the next question after i answer, but provide feedback first. for both types of questions, before proceeding, reprint the question in its own chat bubble, then print the expected 'solid, senior-level' answer in its own chat bubble. allow me to skip to the next question on demand but still reprint the question and print the expected answer. questions should be labelled like: Question (question number) -- ('Conceptual' or 'Hands-on') -- (Skill class) -- (Skill)
